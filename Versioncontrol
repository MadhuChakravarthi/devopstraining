Version control is a system that records changes to files or code over time so that you can go back and retrieve specific versions of those files at any time. It allows you to keep track of changes, collaborate with others, and revert to earlier versions if necessary.

In software development, version control is often used to manage code changes made by multiple developers, as it allows them to work on different parts of the code simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. It also helps to avoid conflicts between code changes and makes it easier to merge changes made by different developers.

There are several version control systems available, including Git, SVN, Mercurial, and Perforce. These systems typically store the different versions of files or code in a repository, which can be accessed by authorized users. Users can then make changes to the code and save their changes to the repository, where they can be tracked and managed by the version control system.
